## Introduction to Context Engineering in AI
In Generative AI, terminology often shifts and adapts as new techniques and challenges emerge. One such term gaining traction recently is context engineering. While it may sound like a novel concept, context engineering builds upon long-established practices in AI and large language model (LLM) development, evolving from the foundational idea of prompt engineering.

### What is context engineering?
Context engineering refers to the art and science of providing the right information, in the right format, at the right time, to an LLM so that it can effectively and plausibly accomplish a given task. This involves dynamically managing the context window of the model — the portion of input data the model considers when generating responses. Context engineering moves beyond static prompts, emphasizing dynamic systems capable of adapting context based on the task, available tools, and user inputs.

Toby, CEO of Shopify, popularized the term by highlighting its importance over traditional prompt engineering. According to him, it involves "providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM." Others in the AI community, like Andrej Karpathy, echo this sentiment, calling it a "delicate art" of filling the context window with precisely the right information.

## From Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering
Prompt engineering traditionally focuses on crafting ideal instructions or prompts for chatbots or language models to maximize task success. However, context engineering expands this notion by:

- Dynamically populating prompts with relevant and up-to-date data.

- Integrating tool descriptions and environmental knowledge.

- Managing large, evolving context windows efficiently.

The LangChain team frames prompt engineering as a subset of context engineering, where prompt engineering handles formatting instructions while context engineering oversees assembling and managing dynamic data inputs.

### Challenges in Context Management for LLMs

Despite the promise of context engineering, effectively managing context is far from trivial. LLMs have inherent limitations and failure modes when dealing with large or poorly curated context windows. Understanding these failure cases is crucial for building robust AI systems.

**1. Context Poisoning**

Context poisoning occurs when hallucinated or erroneous information becomes part of the model's context and is repeatedly referenced, leading the model to reinforce false or misleading knowledge. This phenomenon was notably studied by DeepMind in their Gemini 2.5 agent, where hallucinations during multi-turn interactions caused the agent to fixate on incorrect goals, degrading its performance over time.

**2. Context Distraction**

When context windows grow excessively large, the model may overly focus on repeated or irrelevant information, neglecting its foundational training knowledge. This results in reduced creativity and problem-solving ability. For example, in multi-agent systems or prolonged interactions, agents might favor repeated actions from historical context rather than generating novel solutions.

Technical reports highlight that this distraction effect intensifies beyond certain token thresholds (e.g., 100,000 tokens for Gemini Pro), and smaller models exhibit this issue even earlier (around 32,000 tokens for LLaMA 3 405B). This reveals a practical "distraction ceiling" that limits context length.

**3. Context Confusion**

Context confusion arises when superfluous or irrelevant data in the context leads to low-quality outputs. This is especially problematic when agents are given many tool descriptions, some of which may not be relevant to the current query. Studies show that when multiple tools are provided, models—particularly smaller ones—may randomly invoke irrelevant tools rather than correctly addressing the user prompt.

Limiting the number of active tools in context (suggested to be 10–15) helps mitigate this issue. For instance, a quantized LLaMA 3 model failed when presented with 46 tools but showed better performance with only 19 tools.

**4. Context Clash**

This occurs when conflicting information or instructions coexist in the context, causing the model to produce inconsistent or erroneous outputs. Context clash is a more severe form of confusion, where contradictions directly undermine the model’s reasoning.

Experiments from Microsoft and Salesforce highlight that sharding instructions across multiple turns (progressively adding context) is less effective than providing a concise, unified prompt. Multi-turn context expansion resulted in a significant performance drop (up to 39%), with some models like GPT-3 showing a decrease from 98% accuracy to 64%.
