# 🧩 Getting Started with n8n — The Open-Source Playground for AI Workflows
### **Learn how to automate anything** — from daily reports to AI-powered research agents — using n8n, the open-source orchestration tool that bridges automation and intelligence.

## 🧠 What is n8n?

n8n (short for “nodemation”) is an open-source workflow automation tool that lets you connect different apps, APIs, and AI models without writing a full backend.
You design automations visually — each step in your workflow is a node, connected in sequence to create a logical flow.

Use it to:

- Automate repetitive data tasks (reporting, analytics, notifications)
- Build agentic workflows powered by LLMs
- Orchestrate backend processes like data pipelines or RAG systems

n8n can run locally, on the cloud, or fully self-hosted, giving you complete control over your data and workflows.

Most agentic frameworks emphasize the intelligence part (the “brain”), while n8n emphasizes execution and orchestration (the “nervous system”).
You can even use n8n with LangChain or OpenAI — it provides the backbone to execute, retry, and connect AI-powered steps to real-world APIs.

## ⚙️ Orchestration vs Agents

“Agents” are powerful — they can reason, plan, and act autonomously.
But in real-world production systems, autonomy without orchestration often leads to errors, token waste, or unpredictable outcomes.

That’s where orchestration shines.

n8n lets you control:

- When tasks run (using triggers or schedules)
- What happens on failure (error branches, retries)
- How data flows between AI nodes and APIs
- When humans should step in (approval or human-in-the-loop)

In other words: don’t just build agents — orchestrate them.
Use n8n to wrap your agents in reliable workflows that log, retry, and scale safely.

## ☁️ How to Host n8n

You can use n8n in three main ways:

1. n8n Cloud (SaaS) — simplest way to start, hosted by n8n.io
2. Self-host via Docker (recommended)
3. VPS Hosting — for 24/7 uptime and full control (For example: Hostinger)

Once running, you’ll see the n8n Canvas, where you drag, drop, and connect nodes visually.

## 🧱 n8n Nodes Overview

n8n workflows are built from nodes — each node does one specific task.

### 🔔 Trigger Nodes

Start workflows automatically:
- Schedule Trigger — run daily, weekly, hourly, etc.
- Webhook Trigger — start when an API call hits your endpoint
- Manual Trigger — for testing
- App Triggers — e.g., “When new email arrives in Gmail”

### 🤖 AI & Logic Nodes

- Message a Model — send a prompt to an LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- AI Agent — create an autonomous agent with memory and tools
- If / Switch / Merge — control logic and branches
- Loop / Sub-workflow — iterate or modularize logic

### ⚙️ Integration & Utility Nodes

- HTTP Request — call any API
- Google Sheets / Notion / Slack / Supabase / Airtable
- Code Node — run JavaScript/Python snippets
- Wait, Delay, or No Operation — manage flow timing

### 💬 Human-in-the-loop
Pause the workflow and wait for a human decision (approval or input) before continuing — a key pattern for AI-assisted automation.

## Wrapping Up
n8n isn’t just another automation tool — it’s a bridge between AI and orchestration.
It gives you:
- A visual way to design and debug flows
- Native support for LLMs and agents
- Seamless integration with your entire app stack

Whether you’re automating reports, coordinating agents, or running production-grade RAG pipelines — **n8n is your starting point for AI-native workflows**.
