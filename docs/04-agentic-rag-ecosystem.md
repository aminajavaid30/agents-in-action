## Welcome to Day 4 of the 7-Day Agents in Action Series.

Hi!

My name is [Hamza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzafarooq/), and I am so excited to welcome you our new course. Joining me is [Jaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayarajwani/), who is a ninja in Agents!

In these 7 sessions we will uncover all we can about Agents, what they are, how they work and the whatâ€™s really behind all this hype?

In the first three days, we moved from big picture to architecture.

[Day 1](link) clarified what sets agents apart from GenAI,

[Day 2](link) dug into how agents think and

[Day 3](link) explored memory and how agents remember.

Together, these layers lay the foundation for what comes next: **retrieval-augmented generation**, or RAG - the key to making agents both smart and informed.
