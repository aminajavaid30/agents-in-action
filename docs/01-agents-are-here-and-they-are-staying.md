## Welcome to Day 1 of the 7-Day Agents in Action Series.

Hi!

My name is [Hamza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzafarooq/), and I am so excited to welcome you our new course. Joining me is [Jaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayarajwani/), who is a ninja in Agents!

In these 7 sessions we will uncover all we can about Agents, what they are, how they work and the what’s really behind all this hype?

Let’s get started!

## **The Advent of Agents**

If I had to choose one word to describe the experience of the internet these days, it would be “surreal”. The past year has been a blur of LLM demos, ChatGPT wrappers, and fancy UIs trying to make GenAI feel useful. But under the surface, something much deeper is shifting.

We’re not just building better models. We’re building entirely new kinds of software: systems that can think, remember, and act. We’re entering the era of AI agents

The idea of developing AI agents has become both a necessity and a buzz in 2025. Every person I turn to says the future is Agentic. But what is Agentic? What are Agents in fact? Let’s talk about the evolution of Agents first.

### **Generative AI vs Agents - A Real Difference**
Let me be honest: Gen AI was fun at first. GPT-3 was like having a clever parrot in your pocket. Ask it to write a haiku about Kubernetes? Boom. Done. Summarize an article? Easy. But after the novelty wore off, most people hit the same wall: it talks well, but it doesn’t do much.

The first step beyond pure text was RAG — letting models retrieve real-world knowledge. Then we added images, tables, and code execution and started building multi-modal systems. What went wrong with that? Context-awareness, memory, performing tasks, etc., are some things RAGs cannot handle.

So we started layering memory, planning, and reflection into the loop. That’s the recipe for agents.

#### **What are agents?**

***An artificial intelligence agent is a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals.***

We’re not prompting anymore. We’re assigning work.

In simple words, Agents = LLMs with access to tools and memory, tasked with planning and executing goals.

“Unlike LLMs, Today’s AI agents are an engineering innovation, not an AI innovation”
