## Welcome to Day 6 of the 7-Day Agents in Action Series.

Hi again!

I’m [Hamza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzafarooq/), joined once again by [Jaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayarajwani/) — and today, we’re stepping into the build phase.

If you like this series, we’d love you to have you in our course for AI Agents for Enterprise course on [Maven](https://maven.com/boring-bot/ml-system-design) and be a part of something bigger and join hundreds of builders to develop enterprise level agents.

Now back to the course:

Over the last five days, we’ve set the foundation. We explored how agents evolved from GenAI ([Day 1](link)), how they think and reason ([Day 2](link)), how they remember through different types of memory ([Day 3](link)), how they access real-time knowledge via retrieval ([Day 4](link)), and how they extend their intelligence beyond text through multimodality ([Day 5](link)).
