### Do you think you know MCP?

## Welcome to Day 6 of the 7-Day Agents in Action Series.

Hi again!

I’m [Hamza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamzafarooq/), joined once again by [Jaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayarajwani/) — and today, we’re stepping into the build phase.

If you like this series, we’d love you to have you in our course for AI Agents for Enterprise course on [Maven](https://maven.com/boring-bot/ml-system-design) and be a part of something bigger and join hundreds of builders to develop enterprise level agents.

Now back to the course:

Over the last five days, we’ve set the foundation. We explored how agents evolved from GenAI ([Day 1](link)), how they think and reason ([Day 2](link)), how they remember through different types of memory ([Day 3](link)), how they access real-time knowledge via retrieval ([Day 4](link)), and how they extend their intelligence beyond text through multimodality ([Day 5](link)).

But agents don’t live in isolation. In the real world, they need to talk to other agents, access external tools, and operate safely at scale.

In this article, we will explore how Google is shaping this with its Agent Development Kit (ADK), the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, and the Model Communication Protocol (MCP). These are not just tools - they represent a shift in how agents are designed, orchestrated, and deployed in real-world systems.

We will also unpack how these components work together to build scalable, modular, and secure agentic infrastructure.

# **Building Agents with Google Agent development kit (ADK)**

Let’s start with the question behind every serious AI project:

How do we go from a clever demo to a reliable, reusable agent?

Because here’s the truth: most GenAI agents today are just dressed-up prompts. They might look smart in a single interaction, but they break down quickly when you need structure, memory, collaboration, or consistency.

That’s where Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) comes in, a production-grade framework built to help you move beyond hacks and experiments. ADK gives you the building blocks to create agents that can plan, act, and scale — not just respond.

At its core is the BaseAgent class - a flexible template you can extend to define how your agent reasons, remembers, and decides what to do next. But ADK goes much further: it supports tool use, multi-agent coordination, streaming, memory modules, and evaluation, all with a developer experience that’s actually pleasant.

Think of ADK as your workbench for real-world agent systems.

Not just one chatbot. Not just one clever workflow. A foundation for building intelligent systems that can collaborate, adapt, and operate with guardrails in place.
