We built Agents in Action to change that.</p> <p>This course was born out of a simple belief:</p> <p><code>You shouldn\u2019t need a technical background and years of coding experience to build something intelligent and useful with AI.</code></p> <p>Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into AI agents \u2014 systems that can think, plan, and take real-world actions. Yet, most existing resources stop at the \u201cchat\u201d level. They explain prompts and APIs but rarely show how to connect models with tools, data, and automation to create something that actually works.</p> <p>That\u2019s where Agents in Action comes in.</p> <p>We wanted to bridge the gap between AI theory and real-world application \u2014 giving you not just the concepts, but also the workflows, integrations, and hands-on projects to bring intelligent systems to life.</p> <p>This course takes you step-by-step through the evolution of AI agents \u2014 from understanding how LLMs reason, to building full-fledged agents that can</p> <ul> <li> <p>perform deep research,</p> </li> <li> <p>generate useful content,</p> </li> <li> <p>find prospecting customers, and</p> </li> <li> <p>build other agents.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Every chapter is designed with accessibility and actionability in mind:</p> <ul> <li>You\u2019ll use n8n, a powerful no-code automation platform, to visualize agent logic.</li> <li>You'll learn how to develop interactive frontend for your agents using Lovable.</li> <li>You\u2019ll connect webhooks, APIs, and tools to make your agents truly interactive.</li> <li>You\u2019ll learn to build chatbots, RAG systems, research assistants, and more \u2014 all without heavy coding.</li> </ul> <p>We built this course because we believe the next wave of AI innovation will come not from tech giants, but from makers, creators, and problem-solvers like you \u2014 people who can think creatively and use simple tools to build meaningful, intelligent solutions.</p> <p>So whether you\u2019re a student, a startup founder, a researcher, or just curious about where AI is headed \u2014 this is your invitation to dive in, build your first agent, and become part of the agentic future.</p> <p>Build, connect, and deploy your own AI agents \u2014 one workflow at a time.</p>"},{"location":"#learn-while-you-build","title":"\ud83d\udcda Learn While You Build","text":"<p>All projects here are part of the following courses on Maven:</p> <p>\ud83e\udd16 Agentic AI System Design for PMs</p> <p>\ud83d\udcbb Agent Engineering Bootcamp: Developers Edition</p> <p>These are hands-on, code-first/no-code programs where 10,000+ learners have already joined us to build autonomous, multi-agent systems using n8n and Lovable.</p>"},{"location":"101-hello-n8n/","title":"\ud83d\udcac Hello n8n \u2014 Your First Agent Workflow","text":""},{"location":"101-hello-n8n/#workflow-hello-n8n","title":"\ud83d\udd00 Workflow: Hello n8n","text":"<p>This blog contains the \u201cHello World\u201d AI Workflow for n8n \u2014 updated to use OpenRouter instead of OpenAI.

A single agent designed to do \u201ceverything\u201d is unlikely to perform well in a structured enterprise workflow. Here are three major challenges:</p> <ol> <li>Ambiguity in Real-World Workflows \u2013 Unlike controlled demo environments, business tasks involve ambiguous requirements, incomplete data, and nuanced decision-making.</li> <li>Lack of Integration with Enterprise Systems \u2013 Most AI demos operate in isolation. In real enterprises, agents need to interact with databases, APIs, and knowledge management systems.</li> <li>Hallucination and Lack of Trust \u2013 For AI agents to be adopted, they must be reliable. A one-off success in a demo is irrelevant if the agent can\u2019t consistently perform well on enterprise-grade tasks.</li> </ol> <p>Instead of building broad, generalist agents, we should focus on Vertical Agents - highly specialized AI workers optimized for domain-specific tasks.</p> <p>These agents don\u2019t try to be all-knowing; instead, they are fine-tuned to handle structured workflows with precision, accuracy, and repeatability.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need an agent that does everything. You need one that knows your world. That\u2019s what makes vertical agents so powerful.</p> <p>Vertical agents aren\u2019t just AI. They\u2019re domain-specific digital workers.</p> <p>These agents are trained and designed to work within a narrow context - say, finance, healthcare, compliance, or ops. They are not jack of all trades but within their domain they can outperform general-purpose models by a mile.</p> <p>Let\u2019s take a real-world view of vertical agents:</p> <ol> <li>A compliance agent that reads contracts, flags risk, and drafts corrections.</li> <li>A healthcare agent that updates charts, recommends follow-ups, and ensures HIPAA compliance.</li> <li>A sales agent that knows your CRM schema, tracks conversions, and drafts custom follow-up emails.</li> </ol> <p>These aren\u2019t fancy chatbots. They are autonomous systems with purpose. Think of them as interns who don\u2019t sleep, don\u2019t forget, and don\u2019t need onboarding.</p> <p>According to AIM Research, vertical AI startups could be 10x in value by 2030. This isn\u2019t hype. It\u2019s gravity.</p> <p>Companies adopting vertical agents are reporting 2\u20135x productivity boosts. Some are cutting operational overhead by 80% just by automating the right 20% of tasks. This isn\u2019t software anymore.
