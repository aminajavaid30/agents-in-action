# 🏠 Airbnb n8n Workflow

This folder contains the **Airbnb Search Automation Workflow** for n8n.

---

## ✨ Overview
This workflow automates the process of searching Airbnb listings based on user queries submitted from the frontend app. It leverages 🤖 AI and the 🛠️ MCP Client to fetch, process, and email personalized Airbnb recommendations.

### 🚀 Key Features
- 📥 Receives search requests via webhook from the frontend
- 🤖 Uses AI (OpenAI) to interpret and enrich user queries
- 🌐 Connects to the Airbnb MCP tool for real-time listing data
- 📨 Parses and formats results for email delivery
- 💌 Sends a detailed, styled email with recommendations to the user

---

## 🔄 How It Works
1. 📝 **User submits a search** (location, dates, guests, etc.) via the frontend form.
2. 🌐 **Frontend calls the n8n webhook** (`/webhook/2586fd7a-0113-4719-8038-9b59cbcea6e0`) with the query, email, and name.
3. ⚙️ **Workflow processes the request:**
   - 🤖 AI agent interprets the query and fetches listings using the MCP Client.
   - 🗂️ Results are parsed and formatted.
   - 📧 An email is sent to the user with the best Airbnb options.
