## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Activate Your Workflow

Make sure your **n8n workflow** is active and ready to receive messages.

---

### 2️⃣ Copy the Production Webhook URL

In n8n, open your workflow → click on the **Webhook node** → copy the **Production URL**
(example: `https://n8n.yourdomain.com/webhook/ai-chat`)

---

### 3️⃣ Paste It into the Config in [prompt.md](/build-your-agent-chat/prompt.md)

Open `src/config.ts` and replace the placeholder with your webhook:

```typescript
export const WEBHOOK_URL = "https://n8n.yourdomain.com/webhook/ai-chat";
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run the App

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

✨ **Every reload = a new color theme!**
No other setup required.

---

## 🧭 How It Works

1. You enter your **name** → saved in browser storage.
2. You type a message → sent via `POST` to your n8n webhook.
3. n8n returns the response → shown as the assistant’s reply.
4. All chat history stays local until cleared.

---

## 🪄 Tips

If you don’t see a response:

- Double-check that your **workflow is active**
- Make sure you used the **Production**, not Test, webhook URL
- Check your browser console for errors
