# 🤖 Agents in Action

Welcome to **Agents in Action** — the central open-source playground for building full-stack AI Agents 🚀

This repo is where we share **real, working agent projects** from our live courses and workshops, including:
- 🔗 Frontend interfaces
- ⚙️ Backend logic
- 🔁 Automation flows using **n8n**
- 📦 MCP server + webhooks
- 🛠️ Example datasets, prompts, and use-case templates

Whether you're building a Sales Prospecting Agent, a Research Assistant, or a Knowledge Graph-powered Analyst — this is your go-to lab.
