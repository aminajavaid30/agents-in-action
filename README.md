# Agents in Action
🚀 **Build AI Agents Like a Pro!**

Welcome to the Open Sourced version of my course on AI Agents.

This course is one of the top-rated courses on building AI Agents using no-code/low-code tools. So far, I’ve taught this course to over 1500 professionals, at MAVEN, Stanford, UCLA and University of Minnesota, helping them gain a deep understanding of the levels of agentic architecture, enterprise-grade Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and open source agentic products deployment.

Unlike most courses, this course teaches you how to think about solving real-world problems using agentic AI combined with no-code tools and enabling you to design, build, and deploy your own custom AI products and solutions.

## ⭐ What Students Are Saying
*"Hamza was incredibly available and supportive throughout the course. His guidance on the capstone kept me focused and his framework for thinking about agentic AI use cases is something I’ve already started applying in my day-to-day work. Highly recommend."*

**Valisha**, *Head of Product Strategy*

*"This course really stands out from all the agentic courses out there. Most courses focus on learning theories, or building prototypes, but with this course I can build agentic systems serving my daily life and 10X my productivity."*

**Chilann**, *Product Manager*

*"Having taken several of Hamza's courses (including his LLM Agentic RAG Developer's Edition), I came to this No-Code/Low-Code course eager to expand my toolkit — and it absolutely delivered! This course was simply eye-opening for someone accustomed to traditional build processes. The game-changer: Learning to achieve "Visual Confirmation" with stakeholders in hours, not weeks."*
